# Linx ðŸ”— - URL Shortener

Linx is a simple and lightweight URL shortener built using Node.js and Express. It provides a basic functionality of shortening and redirecting long URLs. The application uses an in-memory collection as its database, with a timeout feature for each entry.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rmirzojonov/linx.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd linx`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Usage
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Features

### URL Shortening
To shorten a URL, make a `POST` request to `/shorten` with the following JSON payload:
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.longurltobeshortened.com"
}
```
The response will contain the shortened URL.

### Redirecting
To access the original URL, simply navigate to the shortened URL generated by the shortening process.

### Database
The in-memory collection stores the shortened URLs along with their corresponding original URLs. Each entry has a timeout, and after the specified duration, the entry is automatically removed from the collection.
